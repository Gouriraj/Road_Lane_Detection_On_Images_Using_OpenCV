# Road_Lane_Detection_on_Image_Using_OpenCV

## Overview
This project involves using OpenCV to detect road lanes in images. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains over 2500 optimized algorithms for various computer vision tasks. Lane detection is a critical aspect of autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This project demonstrates how to use computer vision techniques to identify lane markings on roads.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib.pyplot`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

You can install these using pip:
```sh
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## How it Works
1. **Reading and Preprocessing the Image**: 
   - The input image is read using OpenCV and converted to the RGB color space.
   - The image is then converted to grayscale to simplify the processing.

2. **Edge Detection**:
   - The Canny edge detector is used to detect edges in the grayscale image. This helps in identifying the lane lines by detecting the abrupt intensity changes.

3. **Defining the Region of Interest (ROI)**:
   - A mask is created to focus on the region of the image where lanes are typically present. This helps in reducing the amount of data and noise to process.

4. **Hough Transform for Line Detection**:
   - The Hough Line Transform is applied to detect lines in the edge-detected image. This technique is robust for detecting straight lines in the image.

5. **Drawing the Lines**:
   - The detected lines are drawn on the original image to visualize the lanes.

## Performance
The performance of the lane detection algorithm can be influenced by various factors:
- **Lighting Conditions**: Changes in lighting can affect edge detection.
- **Road Conditions**: Worn-out or obscured lane markings can reduce detection accuracy.
- **Image Resolution**: Higher resolution images provide more details but require more processing power.

## Data Characteristics
The algorithm works best with:
- Clear lane markings on roads.
- Minimal shadows and occlusions.
- Consistent lighting conditions.

## Areas of Improvement
- **Dynamic Region of Interest**: Adapt the ROI dynamically based on the vehicle's speed and steering angle.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implement advanced filtering techniques to remove noise and improve edge detection.
- **Curved Lane Detection**: Enhance the algorithm to detect and handle curved lanes more effectively.
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimize the algorithm for real-time lane detection in videos.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrate machine learning models to improve lane detection accuracy under various conditions. 

This project provides a basic yet effective approach to lane detection using OpenCV. Further improvements can make it robust for real-world applications.
